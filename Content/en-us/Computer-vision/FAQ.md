## Landmark Computer Vision API Frequently Asked Questions

**Question**: *How many landmarks does the model recognize?*

**Answer**: Approximately 9,000 landmarks

-----

**Question**: *What kind of landmarks are recognized?* 

**Answer**: We recognize both natural and man-made popular landmarks around the world.

-----

**Question**: *How did you select your landmarks?*

**Answer**: We used the Bing Satori graph to select popular landmarks from around the world.

-----

**Question**: *How good is your algorithm?*

**Answer**: We prioritized precision over recall for this model. We sacrificed knowing all popular landmarks in the world to identify our chosen landmarks correctly.

-----

**Question**: *I donâ€™t get correct results in my image. Now what?*

**Answer**: Send us feedback using the UserVoice forum. We look forward to hearing feedback, and we use it to continue the improvement of our algorithms.
